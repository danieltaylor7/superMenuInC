I learned the following git commands:
* git init: to initialize project (one time)
* git status: to check project status
* git add: to add files to the project (one time)
* git commit: to commit file changes
* git pull: to pull changes from server
* git push: to push your changes to the server
* git clone: to clone an existing repository
Wow, that is cool :+1: :metal: :octocat:
